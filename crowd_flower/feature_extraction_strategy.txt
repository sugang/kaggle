The most difficult task is to extract features from the free text.
Possible ideas:

1) whether the product name / description contain the full search term
2) percentage of the words in the search term covered
3) Google word2vect, get a vectorized representation for each word (this way we can compare, exercise | sport are similar)
4) convert all words to singular forms in python
5) whether the search terms are of the same order from the product description | 
6) TFID
